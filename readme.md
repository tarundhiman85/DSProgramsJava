Correctness
- final declaration for required data types
- avoid Object creation
- Scanner slows down, use InputReader
- avoid too many static functions

Efficiency
- use library functions as much as possible
-  write freaking jUnit @Test-ing
- assertEquals("RESULT", functionToCall())

Debuggability
- avoid too many global variables
- Separate logic from Pre-processing
- variable/function pneumonics must make sense
